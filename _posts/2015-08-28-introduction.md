# Introduction

## What will you learn?

This tutorial covers development of a game from the very beginning. This includes:

* creating game **architecture**
* writing **game engine**
* making game logic with **scripts**
* creating **assets**
* and **deployment**

And of course, the whole tutorial is built around two libraries - **Irrlicht** and **Newton Game Dynamics**.

> As for now *(15/11/2015)*, the tutorial covers introduction to NewtonGD, Irrlicht, Lua and combining all of
> them into one sample application.

## Why writing everything from scratch? Why not just use *XXX*?

The main reason why this tutorial was written, especially due to the fact there are couple of well-known and
actively discussed/developed/used game engines like **Unreal Engine 4**, **Unity 3D** and others, is:
there is still a need in developers, knowing not only how to make a game using given tools, but how the game
or even those tools are made underneath.

## What should I know to proceed?

You are required to have at least some experience with **C++**, basic knowledge of **graphics** and **game development**
*(just to make sure, you will not call assets "textures" or miss the "script" word' meaning =) )*.

If you are interested - then welcome!
