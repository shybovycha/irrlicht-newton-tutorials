<section>
  <h2>What will you learn?</h2>

  <p>
    This tutorial covers the development of a game from a very beginning. This includes:

    <ul>
      <li>designing the <b>architecture</b> for a game</li>
      <li>developing the <b>game engine</b></li>
      <li>defining game logic with <b>scripts</b></li>
      <li>creating <b>3d models</b></li>
      <li><b>distributing</b> the application</li>
    </ul>

    And of course, the whole tutorial is built around two libraries - <b>Irrlicht</b> and <b>Newton Game Dynamics</b>.

    As for <em>{{ site.time | date: '%d %b %Y' }}</em>, the tutorial covers:

    <ul>
      <li>building application and its dependencies with Bazel</li>
      <li>an introduction to Irrlicht and Newton Game Dynamics</li>
      <li>creating simple Irrlicht application</li>
      <li>defining the application behaviour with Lua scripts</li>
      <li>adding physics simulation with Newton Game Dynamics</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>What should I know to proceed?</h2>

  <p>
    The tutorial assumes you have a solid basics knowledge of C++ and OOP.

  <h2>Why not Unity / Unreal Engine / <em>you name it</em>?</h2>

  <p>
    The main reason why you might be interested in this tutorial, especially due to the fact that there are some well-known and
    actively discussed/developed/used game engines like <b>Unreal Engine 4</b>, <b>Unity 3D</b> and others, is:
    you want to know how things work and thus get most flexibility of your tools (or even start working towards building your own).
